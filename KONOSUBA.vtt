00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.280
Where am I?

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.890
Oh, did I die again?

Episode 7

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.210
<font size="20">"A Second Death in This Freezing Season!"</font>

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.420
After the battle with Verdia,
a leader in the Devil King's army,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.380
the season turned to winter.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.640
That day, I groaned wholeheartedly, 
as if I were coughing up blood:

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.270
I want money!

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.360
Huh? Everyone wants that, obviously!

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.760
Anyway, you're entirely too unresourceful.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.570
You make a goddess like myself 
sleep in a stable every single night!

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.450
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.740
If you understand that, 
then give me more luxury.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.700
Spoil me more!

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.540
Do you not get <i>why</i> I want more money?

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.580
Huh?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.330
Debt!

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.790
Thanks to the debt you've racked up,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.150
most of the reward money we earn

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.470
from every quest we do is 
deducted to repay those debts!

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.840
Just this morning... Just this morning,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.290
when I awoke in the straw of the stable,
my eyelashes were frozen solid!

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.000
If I keep sleeping in that stable,
I'm going to freeze to death for sure!

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.260
I can't help it!

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.820
This city may have perished 
in that battle with Verdia,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.530
if not for my super astounding efforts!

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.660
You should exalt me more!

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.750
All of you should praise me, 
praise me, and spoil me rotten!

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.710
You attention whore!

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.940
If your feats were <i>that</i> astounding,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.540
then the rewards, accolades, 
<i>and</i> debt are all yours!

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.050
Pay off your debts on your own.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.930
Wait! I'm sorry!

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.340
I apologize for getting carried 
away, so don't abandon me!

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.430
Why all the fuss so early in the morning?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.060
Do we have some nice job lined up?

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.960
No, we haven't started looking for work yet.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.440
Given the situation and all...

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.850
What'll we do today?

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.070
I'm sleeping at the inn. It's cold!

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.440
The reward for fighting off a 
leader in the Devil King's army

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.070
was distributed to every 
adventurer who participated.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.360
There's no reason for anyone to go 
hunting dangerous winter monsters

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.120
when their coin pouches are full.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.020
I gladly welcome it, personally.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.180
S-So do I.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.380
The stronger the enemy, the better.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.380
KO-NO-SU-BA!

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.800
The reward is well and good, but there 
seriously aren't any decent quests...

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.790
Kazuma, Kazuma!

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.830
I'm Kazuma.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.260
How about this?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.790
A kill quest for a pack of White Wolves. 
The reward is a million eris!

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.820
Just imagining a pack of wild 
beasts making a mess of me...

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.410
Nope.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.460
Kazuma, Kazuma!

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.230
Yes, I'm Kazuma.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.790
How about this?

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.120
A kill quest for a One-Shot Bear!

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.620
Now is the time for me to 
teach it which of us has

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.250
the stronger one-shot attack 
with my explosion magic!

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.720
I want nothing to do with a monster 
with such a dangerous-sounding name.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.460
I bet we'd die instantly if it 
so much as grazed our necks.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.620
"The mobile fortress 'Destroyer' is approaching,

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.270
so we are recruiting scouts to 
predict the route it will take."

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.220
What is this? What's a "Destroyer"?

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.770
The Destroyer is the Destroyer.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.430
It's a massive fortress 
that moves at high speed.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.220
It lumbers around, trampling everything.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.530
It's oddly popular with children.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.920
I see. I don't get it.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.540
Let's see. What's this?

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.070
A Snow Sprite kill quest?

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.380
Hey, what are Snow Sprites?

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.110
They don't sound all that 
strong, based on the name,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.430
but it says the reward is 100,000 eris each.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.470
There are lots of Snow 
Sprites in the snowy plains.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.750
It's said that spring will come half a 
day sooner for every one you kill.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.400
{\a6}Wow.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.860
They're very weak monsters, 
so they're easily defeated, but...

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.650
If we're accepting that 
quest, I'll go get ready!

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.820
Hey, wait.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.260
You're laughing?

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.860
Snow Sprites, huh?

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.600
Why does this masochistic crusader, 
who always wants to fight strong monsters,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.060
look so happy?

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.950
Still, money takes priority right now!

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.160
These are Snow Sprites?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.020
Hey, can't you do something 
about that outfit?

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.370
You look like some dumb kid going 
cicada-catching in the middle of winter.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.060
I can catch Snow Sprites 
with this, and bottle them up.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.430
I had the idea that if we mix 
them in with our drinks,

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.620
we can have ice-cold drinks whenever we want!

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.440
Well? Aren't I smart?!

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.520
I can see how this is going to play out...

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.240
Darkness, what happened to your armor?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.490
Are you going to be all right in that gear?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.000
No problem.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.620
I'm a little cold, but that in itself is...

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.290
I guess a pervert with steamy thoughts 
has a high body temperature to match.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.680
<font color="#9f2825">Kill Quest</font>

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.680
{\fad(698,1)}Kill the Snow Sprites!

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.270
Number three, wait!

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.270
Damn! It's darting all over!

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.280
There!

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.030
I caught my fourth one! Kazuma, look here!

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.040
I caught a bunch!

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.370
If my kill count comes out too low,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.710
I'll kill the Snow Sprites she caught, too.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.080
Now!

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.640
Kazuma!

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.100
What?

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.450
Can I blow away all the ones in 
the area with explosion magic?

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.920
All right! Wipe them all out!

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.010
Roger!

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.960
By my efflux of deep crimson,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.260
topple this white world!

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.100
Explosion!

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.340
Hey, are you all right?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.570
I got eight of them.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.700
That makes nine defeated Snow Sprites total.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.010
I even went up a level.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.820
Oh, nice going!

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.580
It would've been a little cooler if you 
weren't buried in the snow, though.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.880
What the heck?

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.600
Killing Snow Sprites is totally delectable!

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.710
Why doesn't everybody do this?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.340
There it is!

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:32.900
Huh?

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.900
Wh-What is that?!

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.920
So exciting...

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.820
Sh-She's playing dead...

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.750
Kazuma!

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.420
I'll tell you why adventurers don't 
accept Snow Sprite kill quests.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.350
Huh?

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.010
You lived in Japan,

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.430
so I'm sure you've at least heard the name 
in the news and weather forecasts.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.180
He's the Snow Sprites' master,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.440
and is also said to evoke the image of winter...

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.970
Yes,

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.820
the Winter Shogun has arrived!

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.570
Th-The Winter Shogun!

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.120
One of the specially designated monsters

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.410
the country has put a huge bounty on!

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.900
Huh?!

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.600
I'm sure this monster plans 
to use his position as shogun

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.670
to have his way with me.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.250
I'll resist him,

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.010
but he will likely be beyond my 
capabilities, and I'll be shamed...

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.010
Stupid!

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.770
Everything in this good-for-nothing world, 
the people, the food, and the monsters,

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.700
are all absolutely stupid!

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.800
M-My sword!

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.390
Sprites pick up the subconscious 
thoughts of the people they encounter

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.440
and take their form.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.520
But the only ones strolling 
around outside town

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.260
in winter are mostly just cheat-users
who came here from Japan.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.200
So this guy was brought to life by some
idiot who came here from Japan,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.160
whose train of thought associated 
winter with the Winter Shogun?!

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.810
Talk about a pain in the ass!

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.930
When this is over, I'm gonna step on the girl 
who's been playing dead this whole time.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.440
Kazuma!

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.180
What is it?!

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.050
The Winter Shogun is generous.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.540
If we politely apologize, he'll overlook this!

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.830
Prostrate yourself! 
Prostrate yourself before him!

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.710
Come on, everyone, toss your 
weapons aside and bow down!

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.970
Apologize! You hurry up 
and apologize too, Kazuma!

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.060
The former-something-or-other who appears 
to have abandoned all of her pride

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.650
prostrated herself quite 
magnificently, indeed.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.810
Hey, hurry and bow your head, too!

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.760
There may be nobody watching,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.730
but a knight such as myself would 
never bow her head to a monster.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.820
You try to go off with monsters 
willingly all the time!

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.780
Don't show off your pointless 
pride only at times like these!

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.240
S-Stop it!

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.520
You're forcing me to bow my 
head when I don't want to,

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.390
and shoving my face into the ground!

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.000
Huh?

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.440
What a reward!

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.000
The snow is so cold...

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.580
Kazuma!

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.450
Your weapon, your weapon!

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.780
Hurry and throw down the 
sword you're holding!

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.640
That's right.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.020
I was killed by the Winter Shogun.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.250
Satou Kazuma-san.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.810
Welcome to the afterlife.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.250
I am Eris, the goddess who will 
lead you down a new path.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:17.350
Your life in this world is now over.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.470
This feels familiar.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.700
Is this how it was when I met Aqua, too?

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.230
Are you a goddess of this world?

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.910
Yes. Satou Kazuma-san,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.380
you came all the way from 
peaceful Japan to this world,

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.150
only for this to happen to you...

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.440
What's with this goddess?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.230
Is she sincerely mourning my death?

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.730
She's not like that useless goddess!

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.700
Brave hero who came from a parallel world...

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.750
Y-Yes?

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.180
With my power,

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.730
I shall have you reincarnated in 
peaceful Japan, to an affluent family,

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.760
and will make sure you 
lead a life of comfort.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.010
Huh? You can do that?

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.800
If you wish it.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.510
Seriously?!

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.070
I-If possible, I'd like

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.810
above-average parameters in
charm, wisdom, and strength,

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.400
and I'd be even happier in a life where 
a beautiful girl is my childhood friend!

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.070
Um, that is more than I can...

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.860
Wow, thank goodness!

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.700
I thought it was all over,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.840
but now it feels like I pulled 
through by the skin of my teeth.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.060
This is a reward for trying my hardest, right?

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.080
Because my life up to now had been so awful!

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.570
Yes.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.380
I looked in on your life 
from time to time myself.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.090
I believe your days were 
filled with adversity.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.560
You said it!

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.100
I reincarnated thinking I'd get to go on 
a thrilling adventure, like in a game.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.100
This is like a misleading promo video, isn't it?

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.720
The useless goddess who came 
with me as a reincarnation perk

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.270
was just an arrogant good-for-nothing.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.100
We recruited allies,

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.280
but the only ones who turned up were a crazy

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.900
explosion girl who fell flat 
every time she used magic,

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.400
and a masochistic,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.830
perverted crusader whose attacks always missed.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.380
I was an adventurer,

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.910
but I did construction, side jobs, 
and was forced into cabbage hunting.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.460
I was in debt deep enough to sell an 
organ after defeating a boss enemy.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.120
Sleeping in the stables didn't restore my 
strength, it only froze me nearly to death.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.300
Do you know how it feels to have your 
eyelashes frozen solid every morning?

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.180
The previous world's game balance 
was beyond terrible, if you ask me.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.980
H-Huh?

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.830
Why?

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.020
After you've been reborn,

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.470
may you be blessed once 
more with kind encounters.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.360
I see.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.550
It appears

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.720
I was unexpectedly fond of 
that good-for-nothing world

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.350
that I thought I hated...

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.430
I wanted to adventure with 
those girls a little longer.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.450
Now, return to us, Kazuma!

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.280
Huh?!

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.480
How could you get killed off so easily?

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.300
It's too soon for you to die!

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.660
Wh-What?!

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.240
Th-This voice... Aqua-senpai?!

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.790
Is it really you?!

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.970
Hey, Kazuma, can you hear me?

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.330
I cast recovery magic on your body,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.610
so you can come back to this side now.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.730
Oh, for real?!

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.660
P-Please wait a moment!

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.970
You've been reborn once already, 
so according to the laws of Heaven,

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.300
you can't be revived again!

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.540
Is that true?

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.820
Aqua!

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.160
She says that according to the 
laws of Heaven or whatever,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.930
I can't be revived again since 
I've been reborn once before!

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.430
Huh? What goddess is spouting that nonsense?

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.860
Hey, you! Identify yourself!

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.710
Where does a goddess in charge of a 
backwater like this get off talking to me,

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.550
an elite in charge of Japan, that way?!

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.330
Hey, knock it off!

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.410
The face of the goddess in charge 
of that backwater is twitching now!

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.000
Um,

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.880
she's a goddess called "Eris"...

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.240
Eris?!

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.420
The overrated Eris who's grown cocky 
and even became a unit of currency,

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.630
just because she's worshiped a little 
in the established religion of this world?

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.930
Hey, Kazuma!

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.400
Yes?

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.310
If Eris gives you any more trouble,

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.340
I'll confiscate her breast pads—

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.560
I-I understand!

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.200
Pads?

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.810
An exception! I'll deem this an exception!

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.490
I'll open the gate right now!

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.520
They're pads?

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.740
My goodness,

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.650
Aqua-senpai is as unreasonable as ever.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.650
They're really pads?!

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.030
KONOSUBA!

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.650
I don't mind if they're pads.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.210
You have now been connected 
to the living world.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.030
This normally never happens, you know.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.160
You are called Kazuma-san, correct?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.330
Huh? Oh, uh, yes!

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.910
This is our little secret, okay?

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.610
...zuma! Kazuma, please wake up!

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.110
Kazuma!

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.580
Oh, you're finally awake?

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.730
Sheesh, that girl's so hard-headed.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.330
Kazuma!

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.060
Th-This is kind of extremely embarrassing.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.240
Hey, come on, Kazuma.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.090
What're you blushing for? Say something!

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.280
I brought you back to life, you know.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.370
Don't you have something to say?

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.350
Come on.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:09.230
I want to trade this useless goddess 
for that cute goddess from earlier.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.540
Say something.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.970
Like words of gratitude, or an apology 
for how you've treated such a

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.020
high-class goddess with such 
contempt all this time...

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.240
Goddess change!

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.530
Fine, you damn NEET!

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.250
Why don't I send you to 
meet Eris right away, then?!

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.600
N-Now, now, calm down, Aqua!

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.170
How do you feel?

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.410
Do you feel strange in any way?

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.300
It looks like I'm all right for now.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.580
You are?

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.800
You were killed in such a 
terrible way, after all...

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.620
Huh?

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.120
H-How was I killed?

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.360
You were beheaded by the Winter Shogun.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.310
It was quite a splendid slice.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.820
B-Beheaded?!

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.820
Winter in this world is

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.140
a season where only those who make 
it through the struggle for survival,

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.670
despite the scarce food and harsh environment,

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.710
are allowed to remain alive and active.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.970
There aren't any quests beginners 
like us can complete easily.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.360
Okay, retreat!

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.590
Kill <font color="#4d0a05">T</font><font color="#67402b">he S</font><font color="#dcdbd9">now Spri</font><font color="#5a170e">tes!</font>

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.590
Retired

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.100
KONOSUBA!

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.500
Ta-da!

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.300
A Snow Sprite?

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.230
I didn't only prostrate myself.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.250
I pretended to set them all 
free, but I saved just one.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.420
I guess even the Winter Shogun couldn't 
see through my convincing performance!

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.240
Way to go, Aqua!

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.190
All right, hand it over and I'll kill it.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.560
What?! No!

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.360
I'm going to take this one home
and make it a refrigerator!

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.170
The reward for killing those is 100,000 each!

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.840
No! Not this one!

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.530
I've already given it a name!

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.120
I won't let you kill it!

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.330
Don't! Don't!

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.550
She's resisting more than I expected.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.380
Let her be, Kazuma.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.100
Oh, fine.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.310
I'll raise it with care,

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.440
and when summer comes, 
I'll have it make lots of ice.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.490
Then we'll open a snow cone shop!

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.760
We'll sleep together on hot, restless nights.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.590
Hey, what does this little one eat?

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.820
Do Snow Sprites eat anything to begin with?

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.660
They look so fluffy and soft.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.680
I bet if you put some sugar on it and took 
a bite, it'd actually be really tasty.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.820
I-I won't let you eat it!

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.650
Actually, I've worked up an appetite.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.510
Let's order something!

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.520
I wonder what I should choose.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.390
That goddess...

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.310
She mourned my death so much,

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.760
and smiled kindly when I was revived.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.360
This is our little secret, okay?

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.860
A righteous, beautiful 
girl who's not an oddball!

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:10.500
Finally, so long after I came to this world, the main heroine has appeared!

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.820
Kazuma, aren't you going to eat?

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.580
Huh?

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.170
Hey, how much did you guys order?!

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.800
Once you become as great a magician as I am,

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.200
you require great sacrifices 
in order to function.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.600
What's with you?

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.400
What is it?!

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.750
I brought you back to life today, Kazuma!

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.230
{\a6}Huh?

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.000
There's nothing wrong with a 
reward of this size, is there?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.270
I put a little of the reward 
from the quest into it, too!

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.980
That money was to get us through the winter!

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.030
What's the problem?

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.480
{\a6}What?!

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.070
If we run out of money, we can 
just accept another quest.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.270
What sort of monster would be good next?

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.340
Maybe one that secretes a lot of slime,

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.860
or one with repulsive tentacles?

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.890
Just imagining it makes me 
quiver with excitement!

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.510
On second thought, I should've
reincarnated in Japan.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.740
I made the wrong choice...

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:40.040
The magician of extraordinary genius: Megumin.
Beneath her charming exterior lay tremendous explosion magic, 
which was of such splendor, it was even artistic. 
She brought tears to the eyes of everyone, 
from children to the elderly, and even to wicked monsters. 
Spectators rushed in from around to the world to catch a glimpse 
of her wonderful magic, to the extent it became a subject of public concern.
